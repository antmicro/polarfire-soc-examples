 * @brief segmentation block defines
 *
 * These blocks allow the DDR memory to be allocated to cached, non-cached
 * regions and trace depending on the amount of DDR memory physically connected.
 * Conceptually an address offset is added/subtracted from the DDR address
 * provided by the Core Complex to point at a base address in the DDR memory.
 *
 * The AXI bus simply passes through the segmentation block, and the address
 * is modified.
 *
 * There are two segmentation blocks, they are grouped into the same address
 * ranges as the MPU blocks. Each one has seven 32-segmentation registers, but
 * only two in SEG0 and five in SEG1 are actually implemented.
